# Average Score

We average the scores as an initial assessment of the capabilities. As we have seen in the data, there are very small sample sizes, and a great deal of variability, so the average score for each capability is only an ***estimate*** for the true average score, so we need to show the error interval for how high or low this average could be. We invoke the Central Limit Theorem, which states that sample means are approximately normally distributed, allowing us to take one million bootstrap samples and compute the 95% confidence interval for the average score. The chart below presents these average scores, along with the error interval (95% chance that the true average lies within the interval).

## Key Findings:

- Develop Resistance Forces had the highest average score across Scenarios 1, 2, and 3
- Scenario 2 produced the largest volume of high scoring capabilities
- Chart lists Capabilities ranked by average score across all Scenarios
- Most scores in the Yellow range have an error interval that exceeds 16

# High Risk Capabilities

Since we are dealing with uncertainty, we need to show a risk of a capability scoring at or above 16, which indicates that it is mission critical. The data reveals a large degree of differing scores, so we can show the proportion of scores at the critical level, which provides an idea for the percentage of voters who believe a capability is mission critical in a given scenario. But again, this is only an ***estimate*** for the true risk of a capability scoring as mission critical. We again invoke the Central Limit Theorem and present an error interval for how high or low this risk could be.

# Non-Essential Capabilities

Similarly, we can present the proportion of scores that fall at or below zero, indicating the capability is non-essential for the given scenario. We present the proportions in the heatmap below, and provide the error interval.
